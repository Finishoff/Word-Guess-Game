# Word-Guessing-Game
Hangman game

First javascript game created.
Learning the importance of loops and conditionals for creating the interactive Hangman game.
Array of words is used as a wordbank for correct answers to be compared to.
[Math.floor(Math.random() * words.length)]; is essential to select a different word each session.
Error handing added "toLowerCase" and guessed words already to prevent same guesses countdown.

# How basically works:

* Array of words (bank)

* Pick a random word

* Setup answer array

* Guess from the player (does check to see remaining letters and tries remaining)

* Show answer and prompt of win or gameover is shown.
